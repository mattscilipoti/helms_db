== Helms Db

My good Legolas, did you know that the caverns of Helm's Deep are vast and beautiful?

Sound like your database?

Do you wonder how many tables you have?
Want to change the owner of all the entities in a particular db namespace?
Need to generate an Entity Relationship diagram?

This is an effort to create a single CLI management interface for common databases.

Together, we can subdue your db.  This day we fight!


== Setup

I am (will be?) a Rails Engine.

== Usage
db = Helm::Database.new(configuration) #=> PgDatabase
db.change_owner('Sauron') #=> db (with new owner)
db.tables #=> AR::Relationship of Tables

== The Innards

* Ruby >= 1.9.3
* Dependencies are managed by bundler.

== Design philosphies
  Similar to jQuery, many methods are chainable.  If it doesn't have an obvious return value, we return the object that was acted upon (usually 'self').
